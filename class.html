        <h2>Natural</h2>
    
        <p>There is evidence that there have been significant changes in the Amazon rainforest vegetation over the
            last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of
            sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the
            basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with
            reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is a debate, however,
            over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced
            to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland;other scientists argue
            that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east
            than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical
            limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center
            of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.</p>

            <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are
                consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract
                of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity.
                in ten known species in the world lives in the Amazon rainforest. This constitutes the largest
                collection of living plants and animal species in the world.</p>

            <p>The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species,[38] tens of thousands of plants,
                and some 2,000 birds and mammals. To date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes,
                1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified
                in the region.[40] One in five of all bird species are found in the Amazon rainforest,
                and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. Scientists have
                described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in Brazil alone</p>

            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" target="_blank"> Deforestation</a> is the
                conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas.
                The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and the development
                of the land. In 2018, about 17% of the Amazon rainforest was already destroyed.
                Research suggests that upon reaching about 20–25% (hence 3–8% more), the tipping point
                to flip it into a non-forest ecosystem – degraded savannah – (in eastern, southern
                and central Amazonia) will be reached.</p>
